Q: Could you please add support for XYZGJGNDF?
A: Sorry, this project is at its alpha stage. I won't add any new features
   until there is a stable version.

Q: The files class.ole_pps_root.php and class.ole_pps_file.php are
   missing. Where can I get them?
A: They are only required for big file (>7 MB) support and available
   as a seperate project at
   http://bettina-attack.de/jonny/view.php?path=/projects/php_ole/

Q: How can I create files bigger than 7 MB?
A: Use class.writeexcel_workbookbig.inc.php instead of
   class.writeexcel_workbook.inc.php. You'll need the php_ole project
   available at
   http://bettina-attack.de/jonny/view.php?path=/projects/php_ole/

Q: Will you make the project PEAR compliant?
A: Probably. But this means a lot of work and will require some time.
