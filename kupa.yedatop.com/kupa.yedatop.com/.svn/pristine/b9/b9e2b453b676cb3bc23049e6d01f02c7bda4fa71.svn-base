  <a name="app1"></a><font size="4"><strong>1. Getting Started</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
  Welcome to Group Office. Let's start from the beginning. If you have an administrator, 
  you will have to ask him to make an account for you and any other members that 
  will be using Group Office. If a new employee is added to your company and will 
  be using Group Office, please ask your administrator to create the account and 
  let him/her know what modules to enable for the new user. Remember, it is important 
  to assess the integrity of your employees, if a person is new to the company, 
  you may want to limit their permissions to certain schedulers and projects. 
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top </a></p>
<p><a name="app2"></a><strong><font size="4">2.</font></strong> <font size="4"><strong>Logging 
  in</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
  When you get to your Group Office URL, (web page) you will be asked for your 
  login and password. Enter the appropriate values and proceed to the welcome 
  page. If you are getting an error message upon login, please write down what 
  the error message says and contact your administrator. If it says wrong user 
  name or password, you probably made a typo. Remember to make sure that CAPS 
  LOCK is off and if you are using the numerical keypad, that NUM LOCK is set 
  to on. These are common errors that can cause an incorrect login.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<p><a name="app3"></a><font size="4"><strong>3. Start Page</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
  After you have logged in, you will get to the Start Page. This is the start 
  of your Group-Office session. You will see icons on the screen with a text description 
  underneath of them. Click on the appropriate icon of the feature that you want 
  to use. To get to these applications, you can also use the menus on the top 
  bar. The APPLICATIONS section contains all features available for use. </p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<p><strong><font size="4"><a name="app4"></a>4. Setting up e-mail accounts</font></strong></p>
<p><br>
  To set up an e-mail account in Group-Office, click on the e-mail icon on the 
  start page, or select it from the applications menu. Unless an account has been 
  set up for you, you will see that there is no account yet. You will then proceed 
  to go to the ACCOUNTS page by clicking on the ACCOUNTS icon. When you click 
  this, you will be directed to a page with a number of options that read as follows:</p>
<p>Accounts.../..Add<br>
  You don't have any E-mail accounts configured.</p>
<p>To add your account(s), click on the add page. By default, the client will 
  display the name and <br>
  e-mail address you specified upon sign up. If your e-mail has changed, or you 
  are setting up a different account, change the e-mail to your address that you 
  want to use. The next tab asks what kind of server you will use. For most ISP's 
  in the US, POP3 is the default. You will then need to enter your host name ie. 
  mail.comcast.net / incoming.verizon.net and your username and password. Your 
  username is usually just the name/e-mail address, ie Casey@cmdrweb.com, my username 
  would be &quot;casey&quot;. If you are having trouble with any of these settings, 
  you can always contact your administrator.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<p><br>
  <font size="4"><strong><a name="app5"></a>5. Address Book</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
  The address book is what you will use from your e-mail account to quickly mail 
  to people. If you already have an address book in another program, for example 
  Outlook Express, Outlook, or Balsa, you may export your address book to CSV 
  (comma separated values). As of yet, this is the only supported format for importing 
  messages. Most mail clients support this type of export. After you have exported 
  the file(s), (remember when you are exporting files, put it somewhere that you 
  will remember, so it's easy to find) go into Group Office Email and click on 
  the IMPORT button. This will bring you to a dialog that will ask you to browse 
  for the file. Click on the browse button and select the file you want to import. 
  After the file is selected, click on OK and wait until the process has completed. 
  IMPORTANT!!! Do not do anything else until the import is complete, this will 
  cancel the import. Large address books can take a while to import.</p>
<p>-Adding Contacts:</p>
<p><br>
  To add contacts, click on the add button and fill in all of the proper information 
  followed by clicking on the OK button. </p>
<p>-Selecting members to e-mail to:</p>
<p><br>
  Click on the members tab and select the members to add to your address book.</p>
<p>-Working with Groups</p>
<p><br>
  To add a group, click on the groups button and add a group of your choice. Using 
  groups is helpful when you want to send a message to a large number of people. 
  Working with groups is very efficient for newsletters and announcements. Once 
  you have created a group, you can add members to your group by clicking on the 
  CONTACTS button and move contacts to and from groups. To remove a group, go 
  to the groups section and click the X next to the group you want to delete and 
  confirm removal,</p>
<p>-Viewing your contacts</p>
<p><br>
  To view all of your contacts, click on the contacts button. This will show you 
  all of the contacts that you have, and the groups they are in. To expand a group, 
  you must click the plus tab.</p>
<p>-Exporting your contacts</p>
<p><br>
  To export your Group-Office address book, click on the export icon and select 
  your method of CSV. In most cases, the default is just fine unless a specific 
  client needs CSV to be in a particular format. Click on OK and you will be prompted 
  to save the file. You can then import this list in to your local mail client.</p>
<p>-Authorization</p>
<p><br>
  Authorization is required only for members of select Group-Office users. If 
  a user requires an authorization code, ask the user for their code. Fill in 
  the corresponding forms with the users e-mail address and authorization number.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="app6"></a>6. File Management</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
  The file manager is useful for on-line storage of documents and other important 
  files. The file manager feature is much like using your local file manager ie. 
  Windows Explorer, Nautilus, &amp; Konquerer. </p>
<p>-Uploading files</p>
<p><br>
  To put files on the server, click the upload button. In this section, you will 
  be asked to browse for local files. Select the files that you want to put on 
  the server and click on the OK button. Remember, there is a file size limit 
  on files to be uploaded, if the file(s) selected exceed the limit on uploads, 
  the file(s) will not be put on the server. </p>
<p>-Creating new folders</p>
<p><br>
  To create a new folder, click on the new folder tab, and name your new folder. 
</p>
<p>-Switching between folders</p>
<p><br>
  To switch between folders, you must click on the folder in which you want to 
  browse. When you are in this folder, when you click the upload tab, files will 
  be placed into that folder. </p>
<p>-Deleting files and folders</p>
<p><br>
  To delete a file, click on the box next to the file, and click on the delete 
  icon. You can also select multiple files by checking the boxes next to them, 
  and click on delete. You can also remove folders this way by doing the procedure 
  described above. Folders do not need to be empty to remove them, so be careful 
  when you erase an entire folder.</p>
<p><br>
  -Folder Properties</p>
<p><br>
  Folder properties show information about a folder. To view the properties of 
  a folder, check the box next to the folder and then proceed to click the properties 
  icon. The properties of a folder will tell you detailed information about the 
  folder selected. You will notice a tab on the bottom of the properties page 
  that says &quot;activate sharing&quot;. If you click this tab followed by clicking 
  on the OK tab, two new tabs will appear at the top of the properties dialog 
  box. They are labeled &quot;Read Permissions&quot; and &quot;Write Permissions&quot;. 
  This is an introduction to the next section on File Sharing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>-File Sharing</p>
<p><br>
  OK, you now have the properties dialog opened with your two new tabs. When you 
  go to the Read Permissions tab, you will see a number of users and groups. Select 
  the users and groups that you want to be able to allow other members to view. 
  The selected people will have permission only to read the files, but not to 
  delete or modify the files on the server.<br>
  To give users write permissions, you will follow the same format that you followed 
  for Read permissions. You can allow people to read and not write, or you can 
  allow people to do both. WARNING! People who have write permissions will be 
  able to modify or delete all or any file(s) in your shared folder. </p>
<p><br>
  NOTE: When you share a folder, you are sharing all files and folders within 
  your shared folder, unless you manually specify this. For example the Folder 
  &quot;Casey&quot; is shared and it contains 18 files and two folders containing 
  22 files a piece. All of these will be available to other users. When you make 
  a shared folder, it is good practice to consider who will be viewing it and 
  what you want to share and not share. Personal Documents and letters should 
  not be placed in a Shared Folder or sub-folder of a shared folder.</p>
<p><br>
  To manage your shares, click on the sharing icon. From here you can remove any 
  existing shares. This will not remove any of the files in them, it will only 
  remove the rights of any other member to view your shared folder(s).</p>
<p>- Using the search feature</p>
<p><br>
  Let's say you have a lot of files uploaded, and you cannot locate one. The file 
  search feature is a great way to track down files. To invoke a search, simply 
  click on the search icon, and proceed to the search dialog. There you can type 
  in a keyword to search through your files if you remember the name of it. If 
  you remember the time when you uploaded the files, you can search by date. Simply 
  click on the box(es) next to modified after and/or modified before.</p>
<p>- Using refresh</p>
<p><br>
  If you have uploaded files, and the do not yet appear in your folder(s), you 
  can click the refresh button. If it takes a while, you may just be using a slow 
  connection, and/or the web server on the other end is experiencing a lot of 
  traffic.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="app7"></a>7. Working with menus</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
  You will notice, below the header of each page, a menu tool bar. These include 
  Application, preferences logout, etc.. The menus are there to navigate to the 
  desired page of your choice. To use the menus, place your mouse over the desired 
  section to invoke a drop down menu. Then, move your mouse down to the desired 
  application and single click on it. For example, if I am in the scheduler section 
  and have completed scheduling, and now I want to add a contact to my address 
  book, I simply mouse over the applications section and click on Address Book, 
  it's that simple.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<p><strong><font size="4"><a name="app8"></a>8. Using the SEARCH function.</font></strong></p>
<p><br>
  If you want to do a quick web search while you are in the Group Office application, 
  you can mouse over applications and click on search. Type in a word of your 
  choice, and click on &quot;search&quot;. This will open up a new window to search 
  google.com. This is very useful for finding an answer to a question without 
  having to navigation</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="app9"></a>9. Using the scheduler</strong></font> </p>
<p><br>
  The scheduler is a powerful way to do your online scheduling. It is a very practical 
  and logical way of planning for an event. To get to the scheduler you can click 
  on the scheduler icon on the start page, or select it from the applications 
  menu. </p>
<p>- Adding new schedulers </p>
<p>By default, you only have one scheduler. You can add another scheduler by clicking 
  the schedulers icon. This will bring you to a section which shows what schedulers 
  you have and the option to add another scheduler. Click on &quot;add&quot;, 
  and type the name of the new scheduler in followed by click on the OK button.</p>
<p>- Sharing and Modifying Schedulers</p>
<p>Now that you have added a scheduler, you may want other users to be able to 
  read your scheduler and/or add/remove from your scheduler. </p>
<p>Example: You have created a schedule named &quot;project1&quot; and you want 
  some members to write to this, and others only;y to have read permissions. From 
  start to finish:</p>
<p><br>
  1. Click on schedulers.</p>
<p>2. Click on the pencil icon next to the scheduler name that you want to share. 
</p>
<p>3. This will bring up a new dialog which will allow you to modify values of 
  your scheduler(s)</p>
<p>4. Click on permissions .</p>
<p><br>
  5. This will invoke a new window to pop up.</p>
<p>6. The first one will allow read permissions to the scheduler.</p>
<p>7. For instance, if we want Judy and Matt to read the scheduler, we click on 
  their names, and click apply.</p>
<p>8. Now we want Matt to be able to write to the schedule, but not Judy.</p>
<p>9. Click on &quot;Write Permissions&quot; and select Matt, but not Judy.</p>
<p><br>
  10. If you have a large number of people that you want to view the schedulers, 
  please read the section on Using Groups. </p>
<p><br>
  -Subscribing to shared schedulers.</p>
<p>To subscribe to a scheduler that has been shared, what you will do is click 
  on the schedulers icon, ( the same thing you did to add a scheduler ) and check 
  off the boxes of the schedulers that you are currently not subscribed to. You 
  will then click on OK. Below is a real life example.</p>
<p>Your Co-worker, Danielle, has decided she wants you to share her schedule entitled 
  &quot;Pet Care Meetings&quot;, so she has given you read and write permissions. 
  This does not mean that you are subscribed to the scheduler. You need to add 
  it to your list of schedulers. When you click on the schedulers icon, you will 
  see that now you have a &quot;Pet Care Meetings&quot; scheduler in your list 
  of schedulers, that is because Danielle has allowed you to add and view her 
  scheduler.</p>
<p><br>
  -Creating new appointments.</p>
<p>You can create a new appointment either by clicking on &quot;New Event&quot; 
  or clicking on the day of the appointment at the top of the scheduler, and then 
  clicking on the item that you want the event to start at.</p>
<p><br>
  We'll start with the first method, clicking on New Event. Here are step by step 
  instructions of adding a new event using this method.</p>
<p><br>
  1. First, click on New Event.</p>
<p><br>
  2. This will bring up a section for adding events.</p>
<p>3. The first box, invitees, will allow you to invite other people to view this 
  event. </p>
<p>4. You may manually type in their names, or click on the book/invitees button 
  to invoke a window which will allow you to point and click on the invitees you 
  wish to include.</p>
<p>5. In the title box, type in a descriptive word about your event, for instance: 
  &quot;Meeting with boss&quot;.</p>
<p><br>
  6. In the description box, type in a brief description about your event, for 
  instance: &quot; Meet with boss to discuss financial planning of the Internet 
  Assessment Corporation&quot;.</p>
<p><br>
  7. Next, you will click on how frequent you want the event to occur. If this 
  happens daily, click on the &quot;Daily&quot; button so that &quot;Daily&quot; 
  is checked off. You can choose any occurrences of this.</p>
<p><br>
  8. If you have clicked, &quot;Once&quot;, you will proceed to the next to select 
  the time frame that the event will take place in, using the drop down menus. 
  The cycle section will be grayed out since this event will only be occurring 
  once. If you are doing a one time only event ignore lines 10-12.</p>
<p><br>
  9. If you have chosen a recurring event, the first menu will be grayed out, 
  except for the time in which it occurs. </p>
<p>10. Choose the time in which this event occurs, and then the period in which 
  this event will repeat. For example, if this event occurs daily, and we want 
  it to occur for a week, we choose the time frame within the week that the event 
  should occur.</p>
<p>Subsection- RECURRING EVENTS</p>
<p><br>
  11. Next you will choose which day the event should start on. Lets say your 
  event begins on a Thursday and occurs on a weekly basis, it is an event that 
  occurs on Thursday every week. You will click on the weekly button, and then 
  you will click on the &quot;TH&quot; box. </p>
<p><br>
  The only time when the choice of FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, or FOURTH of a day will 
  occur is when you have selected monthly by day.</p>
<p>12. If you want an unlimited amount of time, or a never ending date, click 
  on the &quot;No Ending Date&quot; box. This will tell Group Office that the 
  event goes on forever. This is good for meetings or events that are part of 
  your schedule that will never change.</p>
<p><br>
  End Subsection</p>
<p><br>
  13. Next, type in the location where this event will occur. Feel free to type 
  anything in this box. It is good practice to type in the address for members 
  that may not know where the exact location is.</p>
<p>14. Next you will be asked where to inherit permissions from. This pertains 
  to scheduler specific permissions. For example, if you wanted to use your personal 
  read/write permissions, you would select &quot;inherit permissions from (your 
  scheduler name)&quot;. If you don't want to inherit any permissions, you can 
  simply select &quot;don't inherit&quot; and the permissions of the current scheduler 
  will be applied.</p>
<p><br>
  15. Finally, you are asked where to place the event. You can place it in one 
  or all of your schedulers by checking the boxes of the schedulers that you want 
  the event to go in to. Click the &quot;OK&quot; button, and you will be redirected 
  to a window in which you can view your appointment.</p>
<p><br>
  The other method is to click on a date on the calendar, which is on the left 
  hand side of the screen. This will bring you to a view of events for that day 
  only. Let's say you want to schedule an event for 9:00 am. You will click on 
  the time, 9:00, and that will bring you to the screen in which you can add an 
  event for that specific day and time. It is a shortcut to having to select the 
  start date/time for your scheduler.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
  -Using views</p>
<p>Views are a way of viewing your schedules in sections. To view your daily events 
  click on &quot;Day View&quot;, weekly events, click on &quot;Week View&quot;, 
  and finally, to view all events, click on &quot;List Events&quot;. This is a 
  great way to break down your schedule so that you can categorize your scheduled 
  events. The default view is Week View.</p>
<p><br>
  -Navigation and changing schedulers</p>
<p>With many schedulers, it can seem quite difficult to sort through them. Group 
  Office was designed for easy scheduler management to avoid the confusion that 
  other group-ware suites offer. You will notice, in the left hand side of your 
  screen, a calendar. Above the calendar, you have Month and Year drop down boxes. 
  Above these boxes is where all of the schedulers are listed. To select a different 
  scheduler, click on the drop down box where the schedulers are listed. This 
  will bring you to the events for the selected scheduler.</p>
<p>Group Office has a great way of navigating the scheduler section. They are 
  all very logical ways of browsing your events. You can select any month/year 
  in the drop down boxes in your scheduler, and then proceed to click on a day/week 
  in the calendar below, and you will be directed to that time frame in your current 
  scheduler. You can also use the tabs at the top when your are in Week View to 
  scroll the weeks forward or backwards. Viewing days is as simple as clicking 
  on them, this will automatically redirect you to the tasks for that day. To 
  view events in weeks, click on the corresponding week, located to the left of 
  the calendar, and this will bring you to a weekly view.</p>
<p><br>
  -Deleting or editing scheduled events</p>
<p>We all make mistakes, luckily, Group Office will allow you to correct your 
  mistakes. For instance: </p>
<p>I made an appointment for 9:30 am, but it was supposed to be for 12:00. I was 
  in a hurry when I posted it to my schedule. Looking back, I realized my mistake 
  and needed to correct it. Here's what I did....</p>
<p><br>
  To edit this mistake, you will click on the pencil icon, next to the event which 
  needs to be corrected. This will invoke a dialog with your appointment already 
  filled in, all you need to do is edit the time on it. Change the time/date/ 
  and/or content to whatever you need to. </p>
<p>As a habit, I like to go through and delete any canceled appointments/plans. 
  This is very easily done in Group Office. Simply find the event that you don't 
  want, and click on the X next to it. Group Office will give you a number of 
  choices on whether you want to delete it from the current scheduler, entirely 
  ( meaning from ALL schedulers! ), and cancel ( if you clicked the X by mistake 
  ). This function provides a quick, yet safe way to remove appointments. </p>

<p><br>
  <strong><font size="4"><a name="pref1"></a>1. Preferences</font></strong></p>
<p><br>
  This section covers basic preferences of Group Office. Highlight the configuration 
  menu with your cursor and click on preferences. Here you can set up your choice 
  of languages, colors, separators and date/time display format. To switch to 
  another theme, click on the drop down menu next to Theme: and select a theme 
  that suits your needs. Remember, themes will only stay the same on your computer, 
  when you go to a different computer, you will have the default theme selected 
  again. Themes are on a per browser basis. If you are using Group Office for 
  <br>
  e-mail, don't de-select the part about using the Group Office mail client unless 
  your administrator has told you otherwise. </p>
<p><a href="#top1">Top</a></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="pref2"></a>2. Using Groups</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
  Groups are a great way of handling a large amount of contacts that can be broken 
  down into sections. Working with groups is easy to do, efficient, and a time 
  saver. To add a group you will go to User Groups under the Configuration menu. 
  To add a group you will click on add and this will bring you to another section. 
  In this section you will type in the name of the group, and check off the selected 
  members of this group. To remove a group, you can simply click on the X next 
  to the name of the group that you want to delete. To edit the group, click on 
  the group name, and add/remove any member that you want from the group. As the 
  owner of the group, no other member can modify your group.</p>

  <strong><font size="4"><a name="pref3"></a>3. Managing your information</font></strong></p>
<p><br>
  To manage your personal information, highlight configuration and click on Your 
  Account. This will allow you to edit any details about yourself. You will notice 
  for options to choose from above the information tab. These options are Security 
  / Privacy / Statistics. We will discuss the security and privacy tabs in the 
  next sections. Statistics however is a way to view when your account was created, 
  the last time you logged in, and how many times you logged in. This is a good 
  way to see if anyone has been in your account without your knowledge. If your 
  computer was being repaired on Tuesday, and you remember logging in once, but 
  the statistics show that you have logged in 10 times, than it might be time 
  to talk to your administrator(s) and change your password.</p>

  <a name="pref4"></a>4. Privacy</font></strong></p>
<p><br>
  Let's face it, there's always that guy in the office that you don't want to 
  have anything to do with. He's always listening in on your conversations and 
  stealing your ideas. Personally, you don't want him knowing about your schedule, 
  files, projects, contacts, etc. because he will steal them. So what do you do? 
  Make yourself invisible! To do this, simply make sure that you are in more than 
  one group, other than his, and un check his name from the list of people that 
  are &quot;allowed&quot; to know that you exist in Group Office. You want to 
  be very specific with this feature, because it is easy to make yourself invisible 
  to everyone. To be completely safe, you can create your own group called &quot;Everyone 
  else but that guy&quot; and add everyone to the group except him. Than you would 
  simply make yourself visible to everyone but him, and since you own the group, 
  he cannot add himself to it. If the creepy guy at work is your systems administrator, 
  you will have a bigger problem altogether! </p>

  <strong><font size="4"><a name="pref5"></a>5. Security</font></strong></p>
<p><br>
  In this section, you can do the following : </p>
<p>Change your password<br>
  Change your authorization code<br>
  Change you secret question/answer</p>
<p>It is a good idea to change these every so often. Remember weak passwords are 
  easily figured out. The same applies for authorization codes. Although it may 
  be easier to remember a password such as your birthday, it is not a good idea 
  to have this as a password. Your secret answer/question should be something 
  that only you, and well maybe your wife/husband if you trust them, should know.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong><font size="5">Using other menus</font></strong></em></p>
<p><br>
  The following sections cover the core applications and basics on how to get 
  started using Group Office. This next section covers the rest of the menus, 
  which can help you navigate quicker, find information about the program, request 
  support, and logging out.</p>
<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="om1"></a>1. Using Bookmarks</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
  Bookmarks are a great way of getting around the web. If you use Internet Explorer, 
  they are called Favorites. In Group Office you can have your own set of bookmarks/favorites 
  within the application, and also to external sites. To add a bookmark, highlight 
  the bookmarks section and click on &quot;Add Bookmark&quot;. This will invoke 
  a menu which will allow you to type in a name for the bookmark, and the URL 
  (web page) of the bookmark. You can also select &quot;Use the current page&quot; 
  for the convenience of adding the page you are on, for example, if you are on 
  the create a new appointment page, and you frequently use this page, you will 
  navigate to that page, click on &quot;use the current page&quot; and click OK. 
  There is a check box at the bottom which will allow you to open it in a new 
  window. This is recommended for all sites outside of Group Office. I prefer 
  to open all of my Group Office links (new events, adding contacts, etc.) in 
  the same window, so I un check the box. </p>
<p><br>
  To modify your bookmarks, you can click on the &quot;Modify Bookmarks&quot; 
  menu and this will direct you to another screen which lists all of your bookmarks. 
  From here you can either delete the bookmarks by clicking on the X next to the 
  bookmark you want to delete, or modify the bookmark by clicking on the bookmark 
  name, followed by entering the modified data.</p>
<p><a href="#top2">Top</a></p>
<p><strong><font size="4"><br>
  <a name="om2"></a>2. Help</font></strong></p>
<p><br>
  In the help section, you will be able to:</p>
<p>Email technical support for help<br>
  Read the license agreement and developers of Group Office</p>
<p>To get technical support click on the &quot;Support&quot; button, and send 
  an email regarding your question with specifics on the topic that you need help 
  on. To read about Group Office, click on &quot;About&quot;. This will tell you 
  about Group Office and the GPL license. </p>
<p><a href="#top2">Top</a></p>
<p><br>
  <font size="4"><strong><a name="om3"></a>3. Logging Out</strong></font></p>
<p>Logging out is imperative! I cannot stress enough how important it is to log 
  out when you are done with your session. To logout of Group Office, simply click 
  the logout button. Logging out is the best way to prevent someone from viewing 
  you information and changing your settings. I would advise logging out even 
  if you will only be away from the computer for 10 minutes. </p>

<p align="center"><strong><em><font size="5">Administrators Guide </font></em></strong></p>
<p>This section is intended for administrators of Group Office, Apache, and MySql. 
  It is not intended for the end user. </p>
<p><strong><font size="4"><a name="admin1"></a>-Installation<br>
  </font></strong><br>
  To install Group Office, you will need to meet a couple of requirements. These 
  are:</p>
<p>*nix Operating System<br>
  Apache Web Server<br>
  MySql database Server<br>
  PHP 4.x</p>
<p>Most linux distributions come with Apache and MySql installed by default. If 
  the do not, you can build them by visiting their web sites.</p>
<p>Apache : http://www.apache.org<br>
  MySql : http://www.MySql.com<br>
  PHP : http://www.php.net</p>
<p>Steps to installing Group Office:</p>
<p>Pre-installation TASKS</p>
<p><br>
  1. Extracting the files and moving them so they are viewable from your web server.</p>
<p>Extract groupoffice-1.0x.tar.gz and move it into you site root.</p>
<p>tar -xvzf groupoffice-1.0x.tar.gz<br>
  mv groupoffice-1.0x/ /var/www/htdocs (or whatever your site root is)</p>
<p>2. Editing PHP.INI</p>
<p>Locate your php.ini file and do the following:<br>
  Set register_globals to ON</p>
<p>Set magic_quotes_gpc to ON</p>
<p>Make sure that sendmail or postfix is set up properly for your platform.</p>
<p>3. Setting up the database</p>
<p>You must first set up a database, before you can proceed with installation.<br>
  command line = mysqladmin -uyourusername -p create groupoffice<br>
  It is also recommend that you set up a groupoffice user for MySql. <br>
  Call the user &quot;groupoffice&quot;<br>
  OK, now assuming that you have set up your database, created a user with the 
  proper permissions, and verified that mysql is running ( ps -e and look for 
  mysqld ) ( if you couldn't complete any of the steps above, it might have been 
  due to the fact that you don't having SQL running, or you have a non-standard 
  configuration.</p>
<p>Now you need to dump a couple of files into your database. <br>
  Browse to the groupoffice-1.0x/lib/sql directory and dump groupoffice.sql and 
  optionally filetypes.sql into the groupoffice database. ( mysql -username -p 
  &lt; groupoffice.sql groupoffice and mysql -uyourname -p &lt; filetypes.sql 
  groupoffice ) <br>
  OK! Now your database is ready to go. </p>
<p>Final Steps</p>
<p><br>
  You need to modify the files in the group office directory for the initial install 
  as follows: <br>
  (These instructions are from the developer, I recommend following them EXACTLY)</p>
<p>Create a folder that the web server can write to and is not open <br>
  to the public (eg. '/home/groupoffice'). This folder should be owned<br>
  by the web server user. Keep in mind there the disk space you need for the users.</p>
<p>ONLY WHEN USING SYSTEM ACCOUNTS</p>
<p> Make sure Sudo is installed (http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/) <br>
  copy 'lib/sudoers' to '/etc/sudoers' and chmod 0440 and chown root:root <br>
  (or modify this file manually when already using sudo).<br>
  Keep in mind that the web server can now:<br>
  - add/remove users<br>
  - change passwords<br>
  - reboot and halt the machine</p>
<p>ONLY WHEN USING SAMBA ACCOUNTS</p>
<p> Make sure Expect is installed (http://expect.nist.gov/) <br>
  copy 'lib/auto_smbadduser.exp' and lib/auto_smbpasswd.exp' to folder '/usr/sbin'.<br>
  chmod 0440 and chown root:root both of these files.</p>
<p> Configure '/etc/php.ini' for file uploads and set register_globals=on and 
  magic_quotes_gpc=on!<br>
  Usually this is already the case.</p>
<p> The install script must be able to write to the folder where 'Group-Office.tpl' 
  <br>
  is located (Only for installation, chmod 777 [Group-Office directory]).</p>
<p> Start a browser, open the page: 'install.php' And follow instructions.</p>
<p> Set the permissions to all Group-Office files to '755' <br>
  (chmod -R 755 [Group-Office directory])</p>
<p>You will then proceed to login as administrator and begin to setup your work 
  environment.</p>
<p><a href="#top3">Top</a></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="admin2"></a>Adding Users</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
  Adding Users to Group Office, click on users in the administrator menu.<br>
  To add users, a good practice is to write down or print out a list of employees 
  who are using Group Office, and assign user names and passwords to each person. 
  They can always change their password after the account is set up. To save myself 
  some time, I usually exclude filling out anything else except user name, password, 
  auth code, and email address. </p>
<p><a href="#top3">Top</a></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="admin3"></a>Adding Modules</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
  To add modules, click on the modules tab under the administrator menu, select 
  modules, and click OK. For users, you can select modules for the users at the 
  time of initial user setup. To remove or add modules after a user is setup, 
  you can click on users, click the user of whom you want to add/remove modules 
  from, and check or un check the modules to be added/removed. </p>
<p><a href="#top3">Top</a></p>
<p><strong><font size="4"><a name="admin4"></a>Using Groups</font></strong></p>
<p><br>
  Groups are a good way to classify people in a large company. As the administrator, 
  it is a good idea to create groups using the user groups menu under the configuration 
  menu. This way, the groups that a person is added to is set by an administrator 
  for extra security.</p>
<p><a href="#top3">Top</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="admin5"></a>Removing Users</strong></font></p>
<p>To remove users, click on the users menu in the administrator menu. Click on 
  the X next to the user you want to delete. </p>
<p><a href="#top3">Top</a></p>
<p><font size="4"><strong><a name="admin6"></a>Editing User Information</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
  Editing user information is very helpful especially when you need to reset a 
  forgotten password! <br>
  ( As a system administrator, you know that this happens very frequently! ) Group 
  Office makes this easy to do! Simply click on the users menu under the administrator 
  menu, and click on the user who needs a password reset. </p>
<p><a href="#top3">Top</a></p>
<p align="center"><br>
  <font size="5"><strong><em>Closing</em></strong></font></p>
<p>Group Office makes it easy for for the systems administrator to authorize and 
  create users. It contains powerful tools for creating a solid and structured 
  application environment. The instructions in this manual should get you started 
  on becoming familiar with the Group Office application administration. A lot 
  can be learned by setting up a couple of demo accounts and using them with a 
  couple of friends. This will give you some time to make mistakes and revelations! 
  I strongly recommend trying a demo office before going through with implementing 
  it in your workplace. Any questions or problems pertaining to administration 
  that is not covered in this manual will be answered by e-mailing <a href="mailto:casey@cmdrweb.com">casey@cmdrweb.com</a>. 
  Please read the documentation before sending email.</p>
